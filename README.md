# CSCI1060U Fall 2022 Demos

This now has its own Git repo, mainly because I really don't like how Replit turned from a dev environment with painless setup to a gen-AI infested slopscape.

You can clone this repo and run `python3 autorun.py` in the root. Make sure you have the `clang` compiler installed.

# Original Description

A folder with every demo made for my CSCI 1060U labs in Fall 2022.

## How to run
I'm making you use the command line for this, as you will end up needing to use the (very scary!!) terminal when you land a job in the CS field. I say "when" because you will get a position. I believe in you. This is aggressive motivation.

1. Open the Console or Shell in Replit, or however you want to open a terminal if you downloaded this Replit locally.
2. Change directory to the lab demo you want to run with `cd`. As an example, if you wanted to run `Lab1`, type `cd Lab1` in the terminal.
3. Compile the `.cpp` file with `g++ <filename>`, where `<filename>` is the name of the `.cpp` source. As an example, I want to compile `Lab1.cpp`, so I type `g++ Lab1.cpp`.
4. Execute the resulting program with `./a.out`.

~~or, you can click "Run". however, i recommend against this, because you're not going to learn anything, and that script is a part of **my portfolio**, not yours~~
