# Lab 3
This was apparently Lab 8 around 6 years ago. I'm so sorry.

## Tips
- In this house, we love `cal`! Seriously though, if you're ever stuck on how to format your calendar **and you're on Linux/MacOS**, type in `cal --help` to see all possible commands, and play around with `cal`.
  - I do not expect you to copy all functionality of it (namely, highlighting today and how it prints the year). It is there for inspiration, just as how my code is here for inspiration.
  - **This does not mean you can copy the source code for `cal`. I will know, and you will only be hurting yourself.**
- Read the Lab 3 page carefully! It has given you a lot of tips as to how to approach this.
  - Try planning out what you want the computer to do in plain English, then translating that to C++ syntax. Sometimes it may not end up as you expect, and that's okay! Keep fixing things up until it does.
